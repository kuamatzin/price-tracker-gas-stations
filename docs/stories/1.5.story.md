### Health Check Specification

[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

**GET /api/health**

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-13T10:00:00Z",
  "services": {
    "database": {
      "status": "connected",
      "latency_ms": 5
    },
    "redis": {
      "status": "connected",
      "latency_ms": 2
    },
    "scraper": {
      "last_run": "2024-01-13T05:00:00Z",
      "status": "completed",
      "next_run": "2024-01-14T05:00:00Z"
    }
  },
  "version": {
    "api": "1.0.0",
    "laravel": "11.x",
    "php": "8.3"
  }
}
```

### Scheduler Configuration

[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#price-scraping-workflow]

The Laravel scheduler should:

1. Run daily at 5 AM (configurable)
2. Execute Node.js scraper via shell command
3. Log execution start/end
4. Handle failures gracefully
5. Send notifications on failure (future)

**Kernel.php Schedule:**

```php
$schedule->command('scraper:run')
    ->dailyAt(config('scraper.run_time', '05:00'))
    ->withoutOverlapping()
    ->appendOutputTo(storage_path('logs/scraper.log'));
```

### Logging Configuration

[Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md]

**Log Channels:**

- `daily`: General application logs with daily rotation
- `error`: Error-level logs for Sentry
- `scraper`: Dedicated scraper execution logs
- `api`: API request/response logs

**Sentry Integration:**

- DSN from Story 1.3: SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN
- Capture all errors level WARNING and above
- Include user context when available
- Sample rate: 100% for errors, 10% for transactions

### Environment Variables

[Source: Stories 1.1, 1.3]

Required in apps/api/.env:

```
APP_ENV=local
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=fuelintel
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=

REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379

SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN=xxx (from Story 1.3)

SCRAPER_RUN_TIME=05:00
SCRAPER_COMMAND="cd ../scraper && npm run scrape"

TELESCOPE_ENABLED=true
```

### API Versioning Strategy

[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

- Base URL: `/api/v1/`
- Version in URL path (not header)
- Deprecation notices in headers for old versions
- Maintain backward compatibility for 6 months

### Security Considerations

[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]

**Required Security Headers:**

- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000

**Rate Limiting:**

- Default: 60 requests per minute
- Configurable per route
- Return 429 with Retry-After header

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Feature tests in apps/api/tests/Feature/
- Unit tests in apps/api/tests/Unit/
- Use PHPUnit 10.x
- Mock external services
- Use test database for integration tests

### Specific Test Cases

1. Test health endpoint returns 200 with all services healthy
2. Verify database connection failure returns degraded status
3. Test Redis connection failure handling
4. Verify scheduler can execute scraper command
5. Test API versioning with /api/v1/ prefix
6. Verify Telescope only loads in local environment
7. Test error handler returns JSON for API requests
8. Verify logs rotate daily
9. Test Sentry integration captures errors
10. Verify rate limiting returns 429 after limit exceeded
