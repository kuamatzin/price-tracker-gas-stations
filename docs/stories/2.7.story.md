# Story 2.7: Backend Multi-Station Support

## Status

In Progress

## Story

**As a** gas station owner with multiple locations,
**I want** to manage multiple stations under one account,
**so that** I can monitor and control pricing across all my stations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User model supports multiple stations through existing user_stations pivot table
2. API endpoints for user station management (assign, list, unassign)
3. API returns station-specific data when station_numero is provided in requests
4. Validation ensures user can only assign existing stations from stations table
5. All existing price, analytics, and alert endpoints filter by selected station_numero
6. User can have multiple stations with different roles (owner, manager, viewer)

## Dev Notes

### Existing Database Structure

```sql
-- Already exists: stations table
CREATE TABLE stations (
    numero VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,  -- PEMEX/CRE ID (e.g., E12345)
    nombre VARCHAR(255),
    direccion TEXT,
    lat DECIMAL(10, 8),
    lng DECIMAL(11, 8),
    entidad_id INTEGER,
    municipio_id INTEGER,
    brand VARCHAR(50),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Already exists: user_stations pivot table
CREATE TABLE user_stations (
    user_id UUID,
    station_numero VARCHAR(50),
    role VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'viewer',  -- owner, manager, viewer
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, station_numero),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (station_numero) REFERENCES stations(numero) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Need to add: station_numero to existing tables
ALTER TABLE prices 
ADD COLUMN station_numero VARCHAR(50) AFTER user_id,
ADD FOREIGN KEY (station_numero) REFERENCES stations(numero);

ALTER TABLE alerts
ADD COLUMN station_numero VARCHAR(50) AFTER user_id,
ADD FOREIGN KEY (station_numero) REFERENCES stations(numero);
```

### API Endpoints Structure

```
// User station management
POST   /api/v1/user/stations         - Assign station to user
GET    /api/v1/user/stations         - List user's stations
DELETE /api/v1/user/stations/{numero} - Unassign station

// Station search (from existing data)
GET    /api/v1/stations/search       - Search available stations

// Updated endpoints with station context (required parameter)
GET    /api/v1/prices?station_numero=E12345
POST   /api/v1/prices?station_numero=E12345
GET    /api/v1/analytics?station_numero=E12345
GET    /api/v1/alerts?station_numero=E12345
```

### Updated User Model Relationships

```php
class User extends Model
{
    // REMOVE old relationship:
    // public function station() { ... }
    
    // ADD new relationship:
    public function stations()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(
            Station::class,
            'user_stations',
            'user_id',
            'station_numero',
            'id',
            'numero'
        )->withPivot('role')->withTimestamps();
    }
}

// Existing Station model (no changes needed)
class Station extends Model
{
    protected $primaryKey = 'numero';
    public $incrementing = false;
    protected $keyType = 'string';
    
    // Existing relationships
    public function users()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(
            User::class,
            'user_stations',
            'station_numero',
            'user_id',
            'numero',
            'id'
        )->withPivot('role')->withTimestamps();
    }
}
```

### Validation Rules

```php
// Assign station to user
$rules = [
    'station_numero' => 'required|exists:stations,numero|unique:user_stations,station_numero,NULL,id,user_id,' . auth()->id(),
    'role' => 'nullable|in:owner,manager,viewer'
];
```

### Request/Response Examples

**Assign Station Request:**
```json
{
    "station_numero": "E12345",
    "role": "owner"
}
```

        {
            "numero": "E12345",
            "nombre": "Pemex Centro Guadalajara",

### Middleware for Station Context

```php
class EnsureStationContext
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $stationNumero = $request->input('station_numero') 
            ?? $request->header('X-Station-Numero');

        if (!$stationNumero) {
            return response()->json(['error' => 'station_numero is required'], 422);
        }

        // Validate user has access to this station
        $userStation = auth()->user()->stations()
            ->where('numero', $stationNumero)
            ->first();
            
        if (!$userStation) {
            return response()->json(['error' => 'Unauthorized access to station'], 403);
        }
        
        // Add to request context
        $request->merge([
            'current_station' => $userStation,
            'station_role' => $userStation->pivot->role
        ]);

        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

## Testing

### Testing Standards

- Location: apps/api/tests/
- Framework: PHPUnit
- Coverage target: 90%
- Use database transactions for cleanup
- Mock external services

### Specific Test Cases

1. User can create multiple stations
2. Station numero must be unique per user
3. Cannot access another user's stations
4. Price data filters by selected station
5. Analytics scoped to specific station
6. Station deletion soft-deletes record
7. Invalid PEMEX number format rejected
8. Address validation works correctly
9. Station list returns only user's stations
10. Station switching updates context
11. Missing station_id uses default
12. Geocoding service integration
