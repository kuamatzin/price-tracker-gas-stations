### Sentry Configuration

[Source: Story 1.3, architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md]

**Three Sentry Projects:**

1. **fuelintel-web** (React)
2. **fuelintel-api** (Laravel)
3. **fuelintel-scraper** (Node.js)

**Laravel Sentry Setup:**

```php
// config/sentry.php
'dsn' => env('SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN'),
'environment' => env('APP_ENV'),
'traces_sample_rate' => env('SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE', 0.1),
'profiles_sample_rate' => env('SENTRY_PROFILES_SAMPLE_RATE', 0.1),
```

**React Sentry Setup:**

```typescript
// main.tsx
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: import.meta.env.VITE_SENTRY_DSN,
  environment: import.meta.env.MODE,
  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing(), new Sentry.Replay()],
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

**Node.js Sentry Setup:**

```typescript
// src/index.ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1,
  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.Http({ tracing: true })],
});
```

### Winston Logger Configuration

[Source: AC 5]

**Scraper Logger Setup:**

```typescript
// src/utils/logger.ts
import winston from "winston";
import DailyRotateFile from "winston-daily-rotate-file";

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || "info",
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.timestamp(),
    winston.format.errors({ stack: true }),
    winston.format.json(),
  ),
  defaultMeta: { service: "scraper" },
  transports: [
    new DailyRotateFile({
      filename: "logs/scraper-%DATE%.log",
      datePattern: "YYYY-MM-DD",
      maxSize: "20m",
      maxFiles: "30d",
    }),
    new DailyRotateFile({
      level: "error",
      filename: "logs/error-%DATE%.log",
      datePattern: "YYYY-MM-DD",
      maxSize: "20m",
      maxFiles: "30d",
    }),
  ],
});

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  logger.add(
    new winston.transports.Console({
      format: winston.format.simple(),
    }),
  );
}
```

### Structured Logging Format

[Source: AC 6]

**Standard Log Entry:**

    "new_price": 23.1,
    "change_percentage": 2.67
  },
  "duration_ms": 145
}
```

**Correlation ID Generation:**

```typescript
// Shared utility
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid";

export function generateCorrelationId(): string {
  return uuidv4();
}

// Pass in headers
headers["X-Correlation-Id"] = correlationId;
```

### Health Check Standardization

## QA Results

- **Date**: 2025-08-15
- **Reviewed By**: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED - All acceptance criteria met

### Findings

#### ✅ Sentry SDK Integration

- All three services (Laravel, React, Node.js) have Sentry properly integrated
- Configuration uses environment variables for secure DSN management
- Appropriate sample rates configured (10% traces, 10% sessions, 100% on error)
- Error boundaries implemented in React with Sentry integration
- Unhandled promise rejections captured in Node.js scraper

#### ✅ Winston Logger Implementation

- Scraper uses Winston with daily rotation configured
- Multiple log levels supported (error, warn, info, debug)
- Log files stored in logs/ directory with appropriate .gitignore
- Console and file transports properly configured
- Structured logging with JSON format for better parsing

#### ✅ Correlation ID Implementation

- Laravel middleware correctly generates/forwards X-Correlation-Id headers
- Correlation IDs passed through webhook requests
- IDs attached to log context for tracing requests across services
- Proper UUID generation for new requests

#### ✅ Health Endpoints

- All services expose health endpoints:
  - Laravel: `/health` with comprehensive service checks
  - Scraper: `/health` endpoint on port 3000
  - Web: `/health.json` static file
- Health endpoints return standardized format with service info

#### ✅ Laravel Telescope

- Telescope successfully installed and configured
- Authorization properly configured for production environments
- Database migrations created and run
- Accessible at `/telescope` route
- Prunes old entries automatically (72 hours retention)

#### ✅ Error Tracking Features

- Proper error boundaries in React with fallback UI
- Sentry breadcrumbs capture user actions and system events
- Performance monitoring enabled with tracing
- Session replay configured for better debugging
- Error grouping and release tracking configured

### Security Assessment

- ✅ Sentry DSN stored in environment variables
- ✅ PII protection enabled (`send_default_pii: false`)
- ✅ SQL query bindings disabled by default in breadcrumbs
- ✅ Telescope protected with authorization gate
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed in health endpoints
- ✅ Log files excluded from version control

### Performance Impact

- Minimal performance overhead from monitoring
- Sample rates appropriately configured (10% for performance)
- Winston async logging prevents blocking operations
- Health endpoints are lightweight and cacheable
- Sentry SDK efficiently batches events

### Test Coverage

- Health endpoint has comprehensive PHPUnit tests
- Correlation ID middleware tested
- Webhook signature verification includes correlation ID tests
- Error boundaries tested in React components

### Technical Excellence

- Clean separation of concerns
- Well-structured configuration files
- Proper use of environment variables
- Good error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Comprehensive monitoring without over-instrumentation

### Recommendations

1. **Consider implementing log aggregation** - While local logging is configured, consider adding centralized log aggregation (ELK, CloudWatch) for production
2. **Add custom Sentry contexts** - Enhance error reports with business-specific context (user roles, feature flags, etc.)
3. **Monitor health endpoint externally** - Set up external monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom) for health endpoints
4. **Review log retention policies** - Current 14-day retention might need adjustment based on compliance requirements
5. **Add performance budgets** - Define and monitor performance budgets using Sentry's performance monitoring

### Conclusion

Story 1.8 successfully implements comprehensive monitoring and logging infrastructure. All acceptance criteria have been met with high-quality implementation following best practices. The monitoring setup provides excellent observability while maintaining security and performance.
