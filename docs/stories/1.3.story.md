## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

[Source: Story 1.1, Story 1.2]

- Story 1.1 established the monorepo structure with environment variable templates
- Story 1.2 created the database schema requiring PostgreSQL 15+
- Environment variables structure already defined in .env.example files

### Service Integration Points

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Required External Services:**

- **Telegram Bot**: BotMan 2.8+ integration in Laravel
- **DeepSeek API**: For Spanish NLP processing
- **Vercel**: Frontend hosting with Edge Network CDN
- **Laravel Forge**: Server management and deployment
- **Vultr**: VPS hosting and S3-compatible object storage
- **Sentry**: Error tracking for all three applications
- **CloudFlare**: Optional CDN for static assets

### Deployment Configuration

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

**Frontend (Vercel):**

- Build Command: `cd apps/web && npm run build`
- Output Directory: `apps/web/dist`
- Framework Preset: Vite
- Environment Variables: VITE_API_URL pointing to Laravel backend

**Backend (Laravel Forge):**

- Server: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with PHP 8.3
- Build Command: `cd apps/api && composer install --no-dev && php artisan optimize`
- Auto-deploy from GitHub main branch
- Environment variables managed in Forge dashboard

### Security Configuration

[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]

**API Keys Storage:**

- Development: .env files (gitignored)
- CI/CD: GitHub Secrets
- Production: Laravel Forge environment variables
- Never commit secrets to repository

**Service Authentication:**

- Telegram: Bot token for webhook authentication
- DeepSeek: API key in Authorization header
- Vultr S3: Access key and secret key
- Sentry: DSN for each project

### Monitoring Setup

[Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md]

**Sentry Projects Configuration:**

1. **fuelintel-web** (React):
   - Enable source maps
   - Set up release tracking
   - Configure user context

2. **fuelintel-api** (Laravel):
   - Enable performance monitoring
   - Configure database query tracking
   - Set up user identification

3. **fuelintel-scraper** (Node.js):
   - Track scraping errors
   - Monitor API call failures
   - Log performance metrics

### GitHub Repository Configuration

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

**Branch Protection Rules:**

- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits pushed
- Require status checks to pass (tests, linting)
- Include administrators in restrictions

**GitHub Actions Secrets Required:**

- VERCEL_TOKEN: For automatic frontend deployment
- FORGE_WEBHOOK_URL: Trigger backend deployment
- SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: Upload source maps
- Database credentials for CI testing

### Cost Considerations

**Free/Low-Cost Services:**

- GitHub: Free for public repos, minimal for private
- Telegram Bot: Free
- CloudFlare: Free tier sufficient for CDN
- Sentry: Free tier includes 5K errors/month

**Paid Services (Monthly Estimates):**

- DeepSeek API: ~$10-50 depending on usage
- Vercel: Free tier likely sufficient, Pro $20/month if needed
- Laravel Forge: $12/month
- Vultr VPS: ~$12-24/month (2-4GB RAM)
- Vultr Object Storage: ~$5/month

### Service Setup Order

The services should be set up in this sequence:

1. GitHub (foundation for everything)
2. Laravel Forge + Vultr (backend infrastructure)
3. Vercel (frontend deployment)
4. Telegram + DeepSeek (application features)
5. Sentry (monitoring)
6. CloudFlare (optimization - optional)

### Critical Environment Variables

**Laravel Backend (.env):**

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL=
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= (Vultr S3)
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= (Vultr S3)

```

**Node.js Scraper (.env):**

```
SENTRY_DSN=

WEBHOOK_URL= (Laravel webhook)
WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Create integration tests for each external service
- Mock external services in unit tests
- Test service failover/fallback mechanisms
- Verify error tracking works in Sentry
- Test deployment pipelines work correctly

### Specific Test Cases

1. Telegram bot responds to test message
2. DeepSeek API returns Spanish language response
3. Vercel deployment triggered by git push
4. Laravel Forge deployment webhook works
5. File upload to Vultr S3 succeeds
6. Sentry receives and displays test error
7. CloudFlare caches static assets (if configured)
