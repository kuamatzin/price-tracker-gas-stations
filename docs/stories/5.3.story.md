# Story 5.3: AI-Powered Recommendations

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** pricing decision maker,
**I want** AI-generated recommendations based on market analysis,
**so that** I can optimize my pricing strategy.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. DeepSeek API analyzes price trends, competitor positions, and historical patterns
2. Recommendations consider day of week, holidays, and seasonal patterns
3. Suggestions include specific actions ("Consider raising Premium by $0.50")
4. Confidence scores indicate recommendation strength based on data quality
5. A/B testing framework tracks recommendation acceptance and outcomes
6. Feedback mechanism allows users to rate recommendation usefulness

  - [ ] Test market analysis data preparation
  - [ ] Feature tests for recommendation API
  - [ ] Test A/B tracking logic
  - [ ] Verify feedback collection flow

## Dev Notes

### DeepSeek API Integration

- AI/NLP: DeepSeek API (Latest) specified for Spanish NLP
- Create service wrapper for API calls
- Implement proper error handling and retries
- Cache API responses to minimize costs
- Use environment variables for API keys
  [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

### Market Analysis Data Sources

- PriceChange model for historical pricing data
- Station model for competitor identification
- Calculate trends using change-only storage pattern
- Group data by fuel_type: 'regular', 'premium', 'diesel'
- Consider radius_km from user preferences
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md#pricechange-model]

### File Locations

Based on project structure:

- Services: apps/api/app/Services/DeepSeekService.php, RecommendationEngine.php
- Models: apps/api/app/Models/Recommendation.php, RecommendationTracking.php
- Controllers: apps/api/app/Http/Controllers/Api/RecommendationController.php
- UI Components: apps/web/src/components/features/recommendations/
- Dashboard: apps/web/src/pages/insights/recommendations/
  [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Caching Strategy

- Cache recommendations: `recommendations:{user_id}:current`
- Cache market analysis: `analysis:{station}:{date}`
- Use Redis for temporary data storage
- Implement cache invalidation on new data
- Follow cache key pattern: `{entity}:{id}:{property}`
  [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Prompt Engineering Considerations

- Include station context and competitor data
- Provide historical price trends
- Specify Mexican fuel market context
- Request Spanish language responses
- Format for structured JSON output
- Include confidence scoring criteria

### A/B Testing Implementation

- Track recommendation_id, user_id, action, timestamp
- Store baseline metrics before recommendation
- Monitor changes for defined period (e.g., 7 days)
- Calculate revenue/margin impact
- Use Laravel Queues for async tracking

## Testing

### Testing Standards from Architecture

- Backend unit tests: apps/api/tests/Unit/
- Test recommendation engine in Unit/RecommendationEngineTest.php
- Mock DeepSeek API calls in tests
- Feature tests: apps/api/tests/Feature/RecommendationApiTest.php
- Frontend tests: apps/web/tests/unit/
- Test recommendation card component rendering
- Verify feedback submission flow
- Use factories for test data generation
