### Previous Story Context

[Source: Stories 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3]

- Story 1.2: stations and price_changes tables with location data
- Story 2.1: User authentication with station association
- Story 2.2: Current pricing endpoints with distance calculation

### Competitor Detection Logic

[Source: AC 1, 4]

**Radius-Based Detection:**

```php
// app/Services/CompetitorService.php
public function getCompetitorsByRadius($station, $radius = 5)
{
    $haversine = "(6371 * acos(cos(radians({$station->lat}))
                  * cos(radians(lat))
                  * cos(radians(lng) - radians({$station->lng}))
                  + sin(radians({$station->lat}))
                  * sin(radians(lat))))";

    return Station::selectRaw("*, {$haversine} AS distance_km")
        ->where('numero', '!=', $station->numero)
        ->whereRaw("{$haversine} < ?", [$radius])
        ->where('is_active', true)
        ->orderBy('distance_km')
        ->get();
}
```

**Municipio-Based Detection:**

```php
public function getCompetitorsByMunicipio($station)
{
    return Station::where('municipio_id', $station->municipio_id)
        ->where('numero', '!=', $station->numero)
        ->where('is_active', true)
        ->get();
}
```

### Ranking Calculation

[Source: AC 2, 5]

**SQL Ranking Query:**

```sql
WITH price_ranks AS (
  SELECT
    s.numero,
    s.nombre,
    pc.fuel_type,
    pc.price,
    RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY pc.fuel_type
      ORDER BY pc.price ASC
    ) as price_rank,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY pc.fuel_type) as total_competitors
  FROM stations s
  JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (station_numero, fuel_type)
      station_numero,
      fuel_type,
      price
    FROM price_changes
    ORDER BY station_numero, fuel_type, changed_at DESC
  ) pc ON s.numero = pc.station_numero
  WHERE s.numero IN (:competitor_ids)
    OR s.numero = :user_station_id
)
SELECT
  fuel_type,
  price_rank,
  total_competitors,
  price,
  ROUND(100.0 * (price_rank - 1) / (total_competitors - 1), 1) as percentile,
  price - MIN(price) OVER (PARTITION BY fuel_type) as diff_from_min,
  MAX(price) OVER (PARTITION BY fuel_type) - price as diff_to_max
FROM price_ranks
WHERE numero = :user_station_id;
```

### Spread Analysis Calculations

[Source: AC 3, 5]

```php
// app/Services/SpreadAnalysisService.php
public function analyzeSpread($userStation, $competitors, $fuelType)
{
    $prices = $this->collectPrices($competitors, $fuelType);
    $userPrice = $this->getUserPrice($userStation, $fuelType);

    $stats = [
        'min' => min($prices),
        'max' => max($prices),
        'avg' => array_sum($prices) / count($prices),
        'median' => $this->calculateMedian($prices),
        'stddev' => $this->calculateStdDev($prices),
        'user_price' => $userPrice,
    ];

    $stats['spread'] = $stats['max'] - $stats['min'];
    $stats['user_position'] = [
        'from_min' => $userPrice - $stats['min'],
        'from_max' => $stats['max'] - $userPrice,
        'from_avg' => $userPrice - $stats['avg'],
        'from_avg_percent' => round(
            (($userPrice - $stats['avg']) / $stats['avg']) * 100, 2
        ),
    ];

    // Quartile analysis
    sort($prices);
    $stats['quartiles'] = [
        'q1' => $this->percentile($prices, 25),
        'q2' => $this->percentile($prices, 50), // median
        'q3' => $this->percentile($prices, 75),
    ];

    $stats['user_quartile'] = $this->determineQuartile(
        $userPrice,
        $stats['quartiles']
    );

    return $stats;
}

### Caching Strategy

[Source: AC 11]

```php
// Cache competitor lists
$competitorsCacheKey = "competitors:{$stationId}:{$mode}:{$radius}";
$competitors = Cache::remember($competitorsCacheKey, 900, function() {
    return $this->competitorService->getCompetitors($params);
});

// Cache analysis results
$analysisCacheKey = "analysis:ranking:{$stationId}:" . date('Y-m-d-H');
$ranking = Cache::remember($analysisCacheKey, 900, function() {
    return $this->analysisService->calculateRanking($params);
});
```

### Performance Optimizations

[Source: AC 11]

```sql
-- Materialized view for competitor analysis
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW competitor_current_prices AS
SELECT
  s.numero,
  s.nombre,
  s.brand,
  s.lat,
  s.lng,
  s.municipio_id,
  s.entidad_id,
  pc.fuel_type,
  pc.price,
  pc.changed_at
FROM stations s
JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT DISTINCT ON (fuel_type)
    fuel_type,
    price,
    changed_at
  FROM price_changes
  WHERE station_numero = s.numero
  ORDER BY fuel_type, changed_at DESC
) pc ON true
WHERE s.is_active = true;

CREATE INDEX idx_competitor_prices_location
ON competitor_current_prices(municipio_id, fuel_type);

-- Refresh every 15 minutes
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY competitor_current_prices;
```

1. **Station Model Fillable Array**
   - Missing `lat`, `lng`, `brand` fields
   - Impact: Low - affects mass assignment only
   - Fix: Add fields to fillable array in Station.php

2. **Raw SQL Coordinates**
   - CompetitorService.php lines 36-40 embed coordinates directly
   - Impact: Low - code readability concern
   - Recommendation: Extract to method for cleaner code

3. **Cache Dependency for Historical Rankings**
   - Historical rankings depend on cache that might be cleared
   - Impact: Medium - potential data inconsistency
   - Recommendation: Consider database storage for historical data

#### ✅ No Critical Issues Found

### Recommendations for Future Iterations

1. **Performance Enhancements**
   - Consider Redis for production caching
   - Implement database connection pooling
   - Enable response compression (gzip)

2. **Code Improvements**
   - Add fields to Station model fillable array
   - Extract coordinate SQL to constants
   - Add database backup for historical rankings

3. **Monitoring**
   - Add custom metrics for recommendation accuracy
   - Track competitor detection performance
   - Monitor materialized view refresh timing

### Deployment Checklist

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage passing
- [x] Security review passed
