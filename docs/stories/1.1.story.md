# Story 1.1: Development Environment Configuration

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to establish the monorepo structure with Docker configuration,
**so that** all team members and AI agents can work in a consistent development environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The monorepo contains clearly structured directories for /scraper (Node.js), /api (Laravel), /web (React), and /shared (common types/utilities)
2. Docker Compose configuration successfully spins up all required services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Node.js, PHP/Laravel)
3. Environment variable templates (.env.example) exist for all services with clear documentation
4. README.md provides clear setup instructions that a new developer can follow in under 15 minutes

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

The monorepo must follow this exact structure:

```
fuelintel/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/           # React frontend
│   ├── api/           # Laravel backend
│   └── scraper/       # Node.js scraper
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/        # Shared TypeScript types/utilities
│   └── config/        # Shared configuration (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
├── infrastructure/
│   └── docker/        # Docker configurations
├── scripts/           # Build/deploy scripts
└── docs/             # Documentation
```

### Technology Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Frontend:**

- TypeScript 5.3+
- React 18.2+
- Vite 5.0+ (build tool)
- shadcn/ui (component library)
- Zustand 4.4+ (state management)
- Tailwind CSS 3.4+
- Axios 1.6+ (HTTP client)

**Backend:**

- PHP 8.3+
- Laravel 11.x
- Laravel Sanctum 3.3+ (authentication)

**Scraper:**

- Node.js 20 LTS
- TypeScript
- Got 13.0+ (HTTP client)

**Infrastructure:**

- PostgreSQL 15+
- Redis 7.0+
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Shared Types Structure

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#lines-69-78]

packages/shared/src/ should contain:

- types/models.ts (Station, PriceChange, User, Alert models)
- types/api.ts (API request/response interfaces)
- constants/fuel.ts (fuel type mappings)
- constants/regions.ts (Mexican states/municipios)
- utils/price.ts (price calculation utilities)
- utils/date.ts (date helper functions)

### Docker Services Configuration

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

Services required in docker-compose.yml:

1. PostgreSQL 15+ with persistent volume
2. Redis 7.0+ for caching/sessions
3. PHP 8.3 with Laravel (use official PHP image)
4. Node.js 20 LTS for scraper

### Environment Variables Structure

Each service needs specific environment variables:

**Root .env.example:**

- NODE_ENV (development/production)
- TZ (timezone)

**Laravel (.env.example):**

- DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
- DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD
- REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PASSWORD, REDIS_PORT
- SANCTUM configurations

**React (.env.example):**

- VITE_API_URL
- VITE_APP_ENV

**Scraper (.env.example):**

- DATABASE_URL (PostgreSQL connection string)
- API_BASE_URL (Laravel API URL)
- SCRAPER_API_KEY

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules:**

- Always define types in packages/shared and import from there
- Never make direct HTTP calls - use the service layer
- Access environment variables only through config objects
- Use consistent naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Organization:**

- Frontend: apps/web/tests/ (unit/, integration/, e2e/)
- Backend: apps/api/tests/ (Unit/, Feature/, Integration/)
- Scraper: apps/scraper/tests/

**Testing Tools:**

- Frontend: Vitest 1.0+
- Backend: PHPUnit 10.x
- E2E: Playwright 1.40+ (to be configured later)

### Git Configuration

Pre-commit hooks should run:

1. ESLint on all JavaScript/TypeScript files
2. Prettier formatting check
3. PHP CS Fixer for Laravel code
4. Prevent commits with linting errors

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Frontend tests: Use Vitest, place in apps/web/tests/
- Backend tests: Use PHPUnit, place in apps/api/tests/
- Scraper tests: Use Jest, place in apps/scraper/tests/
- Each application must have at least one example test that passes
- Test files should follow naming convention: _.test.ts or _.test.tsx for frontend, \*Test.php for backend
