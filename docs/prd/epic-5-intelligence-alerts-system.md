# Epic 5: Intelligence & Alerts System

**Goal:** Transform FuelIntel from a reactive query tool into a proactive intelligence platform that anticipates user needs and provides actionable recommendations. This epic adds the smart layer that monitors market conditions, detects opportunities, and alerts users to important changes. By completion, the platform actively helps station owners optimize their pricing strategy rather than just providing data.

## Story 5.1: Alert Rules Engine

As a platform architect,
I want to build a flexible alert rules engine,
so that users can receive customized notifications based on their criteria.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Rules engine supports conditions based on price changes, thresholds, and competitor movements
2: Alert types include immediate (Telegram), daily digest, and weekly summary
3: Rules can combine multiple conditions with AND/OR logic
4: User-specific alert preferences stored and managed through API
5: Alert history tracked with delivery status and user acknowledgment
6: Admin interface to monitor alert volume and delivery success rates

## Story 5.2: Automated Price Monitoring

As a station owner,
I want automatic monitoring of competitor price changes,
so that I'm immediately informed of market movements.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: System checks for price changes after each scraper run completion
2: Significant changes (>5% or user threshold) trigger immediate alerts
3: Alerts include context: which competitor, fuel type, old/new price, percentage change
4: Daily summary compiles all changes in user's area at configured time
5: Smart grouping prevents alert fatigue (combines multiple small changes)
6: Opt-in for regional alerts beyond immediate competitor radius

## Story 5.3: AI-Powered Recommendations

As a pricing decision maker,
I want AI-generated recommendations based on market analysis,
so that I can optimize my pricing strategy.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: DeepSeek API analyzes price trends, competitor positions, and historical patterns
2: Recommendations consider day of week, holidays, and seasonal patterns
3: Suggestions include specific actions ("Consider raising Premium by $0.50")
4: Confidence scores indicate recommendation strength based on data quality
5: A/B testing framework tracks recommendation acceptance and outcomes
6: Feedback mechanism allows users to rate recommendation usefulness

## Story 5.4: Predictive Analytics

As a strategic planner,
I want predictions about future price movements,
so that I can plan ahead for market changes.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Time series analysis predicts likely price movements for next 7 days
2: Predictions based on historical patterns, trends, and seasonal factors
3: Confidence intervals displayed with predictions (e.g., "likely range $19.50-20.50")
4: Market volatility index indicates prediction reliability
5: Backtesting shows prediction accuracy metrics in dashboard
6: API endpoint provides predictions for integration with business planning tools

## Story 5.5: Opportunity Detection

As a profit optimizer,
I want the system to identify pricing opportunities,
so that I can maximize margins while remaining competitive.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Algorithm identifies when user's prices could be adjusted without losing competitive position
2: Opportunities ranked by potential impact on revenue/margin
3: Notifications for "price ceiling" opportunities when all competitors raise prices
4: Detection of "price floor" warnings when market prices drop significantly
5: Weekly opportunity report summarizes missed and captured opportunities
6: Simulation tool shows potential impact of following recommendations

## Story 5.6: Performance Analytics & Reporting

As a business owner,
I want to track the platform's impact on my business,
so that I can measure ROI and optimize usage.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Dashboard tracks pricing decisions influenced by FuelIntel recommendations
2: Revenue impact calculator estimates value provided by optimized pricing
3: Competitive position tracking shows ranking improvements over time
4: Monthly reports exportable as PDF with executive summary
5: API usage analytics show which features provide most value
