# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The FuelIntel interface embodies "Simplicity Over Complexity" - transforming data-heavy pricing analytics into conversational, actionable insights. Every interaction should feel as natural as asking a colleague for advice, whether through Telegram chat or the web dashboard. The design prioritizes speed and clarity, allowing gas station owners to get pricing intelligence in under 30 seconds while managing their stations on-the-go. Visual hierarchy emphasizes current prices and immediate actions, with progressive disclosure for deeper analytics.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Conversational First**: Natural language queries and bot commands as primary interaction method
- **Single Thumb Navigation**: All critical actions accessible with one-handed mobile use
- **Glanceable Information**: Key metrics visible within 2 seconds of screen load
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-configured views based on user's station location and preferences
- **Progressive Complexity**: Simple price checks to advanced analytics in graduated steps
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Proactive alerts and recommendations based on market conditions

## Core Screens and Views

- **Bot Conversation Interface** - Telegram chat with command menu and natural language input
- **Dashboard Home** - Current prices, competitor comparison, quick stats, and alerts
- **Price Comparison View** - Map and list view of nearby competitors with filtering
- **Historical Trends Screen** - Interactive charts showing price movements over time
- **Alerts & Notifications Center** - Configurable price change alerts and recommendations
- **Station Profile Settings** - User preferences, location settings, alert thresholds
- **Analytics Deep Dive** - Advanced charts and forecasting for power users (future phase)

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The platform will meet WCAG AA standards ensuring usability for all users, including high contrast modes, screen reader compatibility, and keyboard navigation support. Given the target demographic may include older station owners, we'll emphasize larger touch targets (minimum 44x44px) and readable font sizes (minimum 16px base).

## Branding

Clean, professional design reflecting reliability and trust in the fuel industry. Color palette should incorporate subtle fuel industry references (greens for regular, reds for premium) while maintaining a modern, data-driven aesthetic. Typography should be highly legible on small screens with clear numerical displays for prices. No specific brand guidelines provided yet - will follow modern SaaS best practices.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on mobile-first responsive web design optimized for smartphones (iOS/Android browsers) with progressive enhancement for tablet and desktop views. Telegram Bot interface for iOS and Android Telegram apps. No native mobile apps in MVP phase.
