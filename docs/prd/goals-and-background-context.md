# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable gas station owners to make data-driven pricing decisions within minutes instead of hours
- Provide instant competitive intelligence through natural language queries in Spanish
- Aggregate and analyze government pricing data with historical trends unavailable elsewhere
- Reduce time spent on manual competitor price checking from 30 minutes to 2 minutes daily
- Achieve 50 paying gas stations in first 6 months with 25,000 MXN monthly recurring revenue
- Deliver actionable pricing recommendations through mobile-first interfaces (Telegram bot and web dashboard)
- Maintain 99.5% data accuracy with sub-3 second response times for all queries

## Background Context

FuelIntel addresses a critical gap in the Mexican fuel retail market where ~12,000 gas station owners struggle with manual price tracking using poorly designed government platforms. The existing government API (api-reportediario.cne.gob.mx) provides current pricing data but lacks historical analysis, while commercial solutions like gaspre.mx offer overly complex charts that busy station owners don't have time to interpret.

Our solution transforms this complexity into simplicity through AI-powered natural language processing, allowing owners to ask questions like "¿Cuánto está cobrando la competencia por la Premium hoy?" and receive instant, actionable answers. By combining automated data collection, intelligent analytics, and conversational interfaces, FuelIntel turns pricing intelligence from a time-consuming task into a competitive advantage, particularly crucial in Mexico's price-capped regulatory environment where optimal pricing directly impacts profitability.
