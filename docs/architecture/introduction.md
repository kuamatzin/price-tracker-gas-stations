# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for FuelIntel, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

The FuelIntel platform consists of three main applications working in concert:

- **Node.js Scraper Service** - Automated government API data collection and change detection
- **Laravel API Backend** - Core business logic, API endpoints, Telegram bot integration, and AI/NLP processing
- **React Web Frontend** - Mobile-first dashboard for visual analytics and configuration

All three applications will be maintained in a monorepo structure to ensure atomic commits, simplified dependency management, and consistent tooling across the stack.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD and front-end spec, this appears to be a greenfield project with no mention of existing starter templates. The architecture specifies a monorepo containing three distinct applications (/scraper for Node.js, /api for Laravel, /web for React), suggesting we'll build from scratch with best-in-class tools for each service.

**N/A - Greenfield project with custom three-app architecture**
