# Project Brief: FuelIntel

## Executive Summary

FuelIntel is an AI-powered competitive intelligence platform for Mexican gas station owners. By aggregating daily pricing data from government APIs and applying advanced analytics, we provide station owners with actionable insights through an intuitive web dashboard and conversational Telegram bot. Our natural language interface allows owners to ask questions like "¿Cuánto está cobrando la competencia por la Premium hoy?" or "¿Debo subir mis precios de diesel esta semana?" The platform transforms manual price tracking into automated competitive advantage, addressing the gap left by complex existing solutions and the government's basic platform.

**Key Value Proposition:** "Ask your pricing questions in plain Spanish, get instant answers"

## Problem Statement

Mexican gas station owners spend valuable time manually checking competitor prices on a government platform that lacks historical data and has poor usability. The existing government API (api-reportediario.cne.gob.mx) provides current pricing data but offers no historical trends, analytics, or user-friendly interface.

Existing commercial solutions like gaspre.mx offer complex charts that require time to interpret, failing to meet the needs of busy station owners who need quick, actionable insights. With government price caps adding regulatory complexity, owners need instant access to competitive pricing intelligence but are stuck with tools that don't fit their fast-paced business reality.

**Current Pain Points:**

- Manual checking of government platform with poor UX/UI
- No historical data or trend analysis available
- Complex existing solutions requiring time to interpret
- Inability to quickly understand market positioning
- Missing optimal pricing opportunities due to information delays

**Impact:** Missed optimization opportunities, inefficient price setting, and competitive disadvantage in a price-sensitive market.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Components:**

1. **Automated Data Pipeline** - Daily scraping of government APIs with historical storage
2. **AI Chat Interface** - Telegram bot + web chat with natural language processing
3. **Intelligent Analytics** - Price trends, optimization recommendations, competitive alerts
4. **Simple Dashboard** - Clean, mobile-first design for quick insights
5. **Regulatory Intelligence** - Price cap tracking and compliance monitoring

**Key Features:**
